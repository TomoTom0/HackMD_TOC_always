## Features

- change opacity and width of TOC in menu
- toggle TOC hidden/shown in menu

### Problems

- additional buttons in navi bar don't work in Edit mode (because they are from components in view-area)
- ~~if open note in edit mode and in the narrow window, there are no scrollbar of edit mode, so TOC can't appear~~
- if click content in TOC, you can't move it. (This is bacuase of the default feature of CodeMirror)
